### Hello World, I'm Larissa  ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ™‹ I'm an engineer and technology enthusiast with +4 yearsâ€™ experience in commercial projects in the field of industrial automation for Food & Beverage industry. 

ðŸ¤“ Self-learner and curious by nature, Iâ€™ve always been involved with different programming languages and challenges. After taking a Javascript workshop, I felt in love with the language and web development. 

ðŸš€ Since then, I am searching for a career transition and developing my front-end skills by helping to improve user experience and performance.

ðŸ’» If you have some tips about front-end career, I'd love to hear and learn! Let's connect!
